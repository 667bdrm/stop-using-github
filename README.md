GitHub is a enemy of Your freedom

After acquiring by Microsoft GitHub begin frequently do evil things. They are think that they are owners of your source code. They are stealing your code by third party SJWs abuses, they are trying to kill the code that you've created and decided to be available for everyone. There are a lot of great projects already attacked.

I'm open source developer since 1999. I recommend you to stop using closed source patent troll and SJW friendly GitHub and switch to GitLab (or alternatives). If any emergencies you would be able to start your own Hub if they someday go GitHub's way. There are no place for dirty politicans in the Open Source world. Be free!

To GitHub, drupal.org, and other SJW and patent troll friends, etc. I doing encrypted distributed backups of everything that I have. I recover anything if you try to kill that.

All my projects has been backed up at gitlab and localhost.
